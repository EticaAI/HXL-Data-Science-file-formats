The Unicode Standard, Version 13.0 - Code Charts

The file "CodeCharts.pdf" contains all of the final code charts for
Unicode 13.0. Warning: this file is large (115,786,788 bytes).
The charts in CodeCharts.pdf do not highlight the new characters.

Fonts

The shapes of the reference glyphs used in the Unicode Code Charts are not
prescriptive. Considerable variation is to be expected in actual fonts.
The particular fonts used in these charts were provided to the Unicode
Consortium by a number of different font designers, who own the rights
to the fonts. See http://www.unicode.org/charts/fonts.html for a list.

You may freely use the Unicode Code Charts for personal or internal business
uses only. You may not incorporate them either wholly or in part into
any product or publication, or otherwise distribute them without express
written permission from the Unicode Consortium. However, you may provide

The fonts and font data used in production of the Unicode Code Charts may NOT
be extracted, or used in any other way in any product or publication,
