"""Core facade to policy, standard or law compliance-like methods

TL;DR: check if user is authorized to do something based on context and then
       take an decision (from just remove the sensitive content to raise
       warnings)

While most automated tools that do compliance checks tend to be about
technical standards or conventions on files ("does this file have this
attribute?" "Does this field is the right date type?")" the main goal of
this module is focused on more police/law for common tasks related to
process the data.

Please note that do exist limitations on automated checks:

- The quality of the checks are based on how the input data was HXLated
- The number of false positives is likely to be high even if you use rules
  from one domain (like education) for people who work on healthcare.
- Consider implement additional features, like require user credentials, or
  maybe allow reduce severity based on infrastruture (like if be aware that
  someone granted that the data would be deleted).

Notes:
- While the core library will not enforce these functions, the documentation
  serve as hint for implementers.
- Also note that, if eventually HXLm becomes used, part of the rules would not
  be public outside your organization.

    This check is not about if a column COULD, but if SHOULD, be decrypted in
    the current context. The semantics here are very important: while the
    program may try the default decryption strategy (like a key that the user
    or the well controlled data proxy may actually have, but will not tell to
    user) if the user is not authorized to decrypt this type of column, the
    software should not offer this feature.

    Also, the implementers use the Tolerance as a hint to not trow Exception
    if you are doing a quick check on all the table the user just opened, but
    be less tolerant if the user explicitly ask to decrypt.
