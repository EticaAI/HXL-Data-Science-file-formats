# TODO: Since AuxLoadPolicy have an flag 'enforce_startup_generic_tests'
#       We could choose some server (or a list of servers), and use files
#       like this one https://www.un.org/robots.txt as check if network is
#       enabled when an Policy is so high that this would need to be blocked
#       at network level.
#       I'm not sure if do exist some other more neutral server, but it's
#       important any (even if as example), check is done, the server should
#       not be something that could be used to track users.
