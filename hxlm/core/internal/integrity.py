        "The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used hash function
        producing a 128-bit hash value. Although MD5 was initially designed
        to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found
        to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities.

        It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity,

          availible, consider using the _get_hash_sha3_256() as it's the same
          of the output (see 'Length extension attack')

    From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2 (text from 2021-03-22):
        "SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash
        functions designed by the United States National Security Agency
        (NSA) and first published in 2001.

        Currently, the best public attacks break preimage resistance for
        52 out of 64 rounds of SHA-256 or 57 out of 80 rounds of SHA-512,
        and collision resistance for 46 out of 64 rounds of SHA-256."

    From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack (2021-03-22):
        "In cryptography and computer security, a length extension attack is
        a type of attack where an attacker can use Hash(message1) and the
        length of message1 to calculate Hash(message1 â€– message2) for an
        attacker-controlled message2, without needing to know the content of
        message1. Algorithms like MD5, SHA-1 and most of SHA-2 that are based
        on the Merkleâ€“DamgÃ¥rd construction are susceptible to this kind of
        attack.[1][2][3]

        When a Merkleâ€“DamgÃ¥rd based hash is misused as a message
        authentication code with construction H(secret â€– message),[1] and
        message and the length of secret is known, a length extension attack
        allows anyone to include extra information at the end of the message
        and produce a valid hash without knowing the secret."
