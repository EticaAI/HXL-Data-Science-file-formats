    "Interactive machine translation (IMT), is a specific sub-field of
      computer-aided translation. Under this translation paradigm, the computer
      software that assists the human translator attempts to predict the
      text the user is going to input by taking into account all the
      information it has available. Whenever such prediction is wrong and
      the user provides feedback to the system, a new prediction is performed
      considering the new information available. Such process is repeated
      until the translation provided matches the user's
      expectations.

      Interactive machine translation is specially interesting when
      translating texts in domains where it is not admissible to output a
      translation containing errors, hence requiring a human user to amend
      the translations provided by the system. In such cases,
      interactive machine translation has been proved to provide benefit
      to potential users.[1][2]" -- Wikipedia
