"""hxlm.core.schema.vocab prepare internal vocabularies to be used by schema

This file is meant to accept 3 categories of internal vocabularies:

- core_vocab.yml (default, always): the (lastest) default vocabulary inside
  the core of the library.
- core_vocab_deprecated_vNNN (not implemented, but may be used): if over time
  breaking chances do occur on the default core_vocab.yml, an file may replace
  the old one
    - This approach may be the ideal to allow faster changes at cost of
      additional logic (to be used outside the core library).
    - Note that the fixes may also be provided, just not on the core library
    - Note that this file may force reload and discard (or merge) the core
      library after a new file is parsed; does not need to be explained upfront
- user_localized_translation.yml (optional, needs to be given together with
  the original AUP): for both new languages not supported, or for
  errors/misspelling on hcompliance rules were is unviable to ask from source
  to update, the tool can explicitly allow am separate file where an human
  acceptable the legal responsibility.
    - Special measures (like at least by default log chances compared to the
      core_vocab.yml for future auditing; even if such log is encrypted) may
      be taken in such cases by default, in special if do not exist an human
      capable of review.
Â  Â  - Please note that such extra steps are not a signal of untrust; is much
      more likely that this can help debug errors or give trust to who would
      use such workflows that do exist and a chain of accountability.

TODO: implement https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html to
      allow some way to diff customizations users done with vocabularies
