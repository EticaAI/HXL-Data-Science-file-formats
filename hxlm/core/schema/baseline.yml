# FILE: hxlm.core.schema.baseline.yml
# DESCRIPTION: while hxlm.core have these values mostly hardcoded you can use
#              this file as reference for implementations outside python

### HXLM CORE LIBRARY _________________________________________________________

## When local processing is not sufficient, which HXL-proxy use? ..............

# TODO: allow user change the proxy URL (e.g. if using Docker or other service)
HXLPROXY_URL: "https://proxy.hxlstandard.org"

## When storing data locally (ex.: urnresolver) ...............................
# Example: /home/user/.config/hxlm/
HXLM_CONFIG_BASE: "~/.config/hxlm/"

# While (as version v0.7.3) not implemented even as proof of concept, this
# directory structure draft already not just place to store data, but policy
# about this data (that eventually could instruct if some use is authorized
# if the user, for example, is preparing data to someone else). While it is
# less likely that acceptable use police themselves may require a high level
# of secrecy, we intentionally have an separate base directory for store data.


# TODO: these variables are hardcoded on code. We need at least allow override
#       with enviroment variables
# ref acceptable-use-policies
HXLM_DATA_POLICY_BASE: "~/.config/hxlm/policy/"
# Default place to search
HXLM_DATA_VAULT_BASE: "~/.local/var/hxlm/data/"
# Alternative place to search
HXLM_DATA_VAULT_BASE_ALT: ""
 # Path active to write. Makes sense be HXLM_DATA_VAULT_(BASE|_ALT)
HXLM_DATA_VAULT_BASE_ACTIVE: "~/.local/var/hxlm/data/"

# Note: despite name "(data) vault", as long as the acceptable-usage-policies
#       are readable (and this does not need to be machine parseable, could be
#       just text), the human who is working to store/prepare (a equivalent
#       to 'airline dispatcher') do not need to unencripted access to some data
#       contents. So if someting is too sensible, even if the human is
#       trusted to not leak data (but could be forced) people could be
#       instructed to encrypt some types of information and only give
#       decription access (think like send the password via private messaging)
#       to the destinatary.

HTYPE_PRIMITIVES:
  HTYPE_TRUE: "TRUE"

  HTYPE_UNKNOW: "?"
  # NOTE: Encryption is likely to be a very, VERY common case on HXLated datasets
  #       both at column and row level (Think Encryption At Rest) ant this
  #       actually must be well done, since just encrypt/protect the full dataset
  #       limit valid cases. The difference betwen this and MISSING/UNKNOW
  #       is user tools actually have partial information to decrypt.
  # NOTE: One original data point that is decrypted by the user is converted
  #       to whatever was the original value instead of this. This can be used
  #       on much more than just boolean.
  HTYPE_ENCRYPTED: "!"  # Note: the "!" different from HTYPE_UNKNOW="?" that
                        # actually can be stored explicitly as ?, is an
                        # pseudo representation. Encryption-aware tools could
                        # choose to print "!" while internally have the real
                        # value. Also, if exported tables do have "!" as value
                        # Encryption-aware tools could still label the data as
                        # encrypted while don't offer how to decrypt (since they
                        # technically could not do it)
