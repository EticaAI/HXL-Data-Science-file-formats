  # NOTE: Encryption is likely to be a very, VERY common case on HXLated datasets
  #       both at column and row level (Think Encryption At Rest) ant this
  #       actually must be well done, since just encrypt/protect the full dataset
  #       limit valid cases. The difference betwen this and MISSING/UNKNOW
  #       is user tools actually have partial information to decrypt.
  # NOTE: One original data point that is decrypted by the user is converted
  #       to whatever was the original value instead of this. This can be used
  #       on much more than just boolean.
  HTYPE_ENCRYPTED: "!"  # Note: the "!" different from HTYPE_UNKNOW="?" that
                        # actually can be stored explicitly as ?, is an
                        # pseudo representation. Encryption-aware tools could
                        # choose to print "!" while internally have the real
                        # value. Also, if exported tables do have "!" as value
                        # Encryption-aware tools could still label the data as
                        # encrypted while don't offer how to decrypt (since they
                        # technically could not do it)
