# The heart of the HXLm ongologies

When feasible, even if it make harder to do initial implementation or be
_a bit less efficient_ than use dedicated _"advanced"_ strategies with
state of the art tools, the internal parts of hxlm.core that deal with
[ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)) will
be stored in this folder.

This strategy is likely to make it easier for non-developers to update
internals, like individuals interested in adding new languages or proposing
corrections.
