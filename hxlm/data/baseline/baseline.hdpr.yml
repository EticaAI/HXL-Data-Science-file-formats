#       re-implemented with the refactoring of hxlm.core.model.hdp to
#       hxlm.core.hdp. (Emerson Rocha, 2021-03-29 07:55 UTC)

# NOTE: Compliance files, compared to any other hmeta representation, SHOULD
#       allow end users native language including the key terms like
#       'hcompliance', 'source', 'tags', etc. The reasoning behind this is
#       the idea behind compliance rules is be able to be validated by
#       local judges, administrators, etc. Right-to-left languages may
#       need extra work (Emerson Rocha, 2021-03-01 05:08 UTC)
