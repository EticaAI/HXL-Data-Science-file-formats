#
#   DESCRIPTION:  hxl2example is an example script to create other scripts with
#                 some bare minimum command line interface that could work.
#                 With exception of external libraries, the hxl2example is meant
#                 to be somewhat self-contained one-file executable ready to
#                 just be added to the path
